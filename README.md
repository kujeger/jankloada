# jankloada

A simple mod profile manager for Total War: Warhammer 3.

It's janky. Beware of gretchin with spanners!

Lets you read you current mod list, and save/apply profiles -- lists of which mods are active. Created to make multiplayer mod-syncing less annoying.

This manager won't handle anything around adding the mods themselves; it simply lets you apply mod orders and active status to the config file used by Creative Assembly's launcher.
